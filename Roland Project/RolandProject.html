			<h4> The Internet </h4>
			<p>
				The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of HTML (hypertext markup language) that glues everything together via hyperlinks. A browser, such as google chrome, make requests via the internet, the world's largest comuter network, using http, the main protocall of the web, to servers, computers that host the files that make up the web.
			</p>
			<div>
				<em>HTML is the heart of the web.</em> It is made up of:
				<ul> 
					<li>text content (what you see).</li>
					<li>markup (what it looks like).</li>
					<li>references to other documents (such as images or links to other pages).</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>

			<h4> Tags </h4>
			<p>
				When coding, tags are used to tell the computer what to do. It is important that the code is accurate, because a computer can't do anything if there are any mistakes. Computers cannot assume what you <em>meant</em> to write.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tags tell the computer whether to make text bold or italicized, whether to put the text into a paragraph, and controls spacing in between the lines of text. A tag consists of a command, such at "div", within lesser-than and a greater-than symbols. Some tags are called void tags because they do not require a closing tag. One such example is the "img" tag, used for inserting an image. Alternate text is usually required when writing this tag in case someone is blind, or the image file does not exist anymore.
			</p>

			<h4> Cascading Style Sheets </h4>
			<p>
				Cascading style sheets, or CSS, determines the styling of the HTML. With CSS, you can change text fonts, backround colors, create bullet points, and set dimesions of your page's boxes. CSS is important in making your web page look pleasing to the user's eye.
			</p>
			<p>
				When using CSS, the code works similar to how a country's laws work. The national law applies to all people within those parameters. The state law applies to all people within that state, but not everyone in the country. A county law applies to everyone in that county, but not all the people within the state or country. But no matter what rules your county uses, everyoneone still has to follow the national rules. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The same idea applies to CSS code. A code can apply to everything within a parameter, and then there can be more specific code inside of those defined borders, but all code must still follow the most general rules.
			</p>
			<h4> Repetition </h4>
			<p>
				It is very important to refrain from repetition while coding. All code written should be as simple as possible, and all repeating elements can be explained to the computer program through CSS.
			</p>
			<h4>Box Positioning</h4>
			<div>
				When coding for a webpage, the coder will be given a design mock, a template for what the webpage should look like. With the design mock in sight, code, test, and refine, until your webpage looks just like the design mock. The steps to code for a design mock are:
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Get the structure down, using the red borders.</li>
					<li>Insert the needed tags (heading, ect.)</li>
					<li>Code the sizes of the boxes on your page</li>
					<li>Complete the layout of how you want the page to look</li>
					<li>Lastly, focus on the smaller details.</li>
				</ol>

			<h4>Programming Languages</h4>
			<p>
				Computer programming languages were invented for two main reasons:
				<ul>
					<li>Ambiguity</li>
					<li>Verbosity</li>
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p>
				First, ambiguity is important because developed languages can be interpreted different ways to separate people, whereas a computer can only interpret things literally. If you accidentaly spell something wrong in code, there is no leeway in the meaning of your code, the computer will not understand the instructions that you wrote for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Second, verbosity. If we had to use natural language in programming, there would be way to much text in the code. Computer programming languages were purposly created with brief tags and text.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title"> Stage 2: Lesson 2 </h2>
			<h4>Python</h4>
			<p>
				Python is one example of a computer program. When you write code for this program, you are writing instructions for the Python Interpreter to convert into instructions that the computer will execute. It requires a specific syntax; with even just a minor typo, the interpreter will not be able to carry out the conversion properly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using basic arithmetic, Python "expressions" give the correct instructions in order to execute the program. Using this basic arithmetic and variables, a word or phrase that represents a given equation, you can begin to make Python do more complicated things.
			</p>
			<p>
				When using words or letters need to be used as a variable, use single('') or double("") quotes. It is important that you close the string with the same type of quotes you used to open it! (eg. 'hats', <em>not</em> 'hats"). 
			</p>	
			<p>
				There are a few usful tools while using strings. One is the <em>concatenation</em> of strings, or adding the strings using the '+' symbol. This allows you to put words, symbols, letters, or a mix of them together (eg. 'hats' + '!' = hats!). <em> Note: you cannot concatenate a string and a number</em>. Another useful tool is '.find'. By using the equation '&ltstring>.find (&ltstring>)', it is possible to search for and find a target string within a larger string. If the target string is found, python will output the number of the first position that target string appears within the search string. If the target string is not found, python will output '-1'.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title"> Stage 2: Lesson 3 <h2>
			<h4>Functions Within Python</h4>
			<p>
				Also known as procedures, functions take given input, does a specified job to that input, and then gives output. They work by Input-> Function-> Output. Once you have written a function once, you never have to program it again. This allows for programmers to avoid repitition. Using inputs within the procedures, equations can be programmed to work when printed. If the equation doesn't have a return statement, then the ouput will be 'none'.
			</p>
			<h4>If and While</h4>
			<p>
				'If' executes when the test expression is true. This is a helpful tool when writing expressions that you may only want to execute under certain conditions. If the conditions you programmed are correct, then the 'if' statement will compute.
			</p>
			<p>
				While executes <em>as long as</em> the test expression is true. While can be used to have a test expression compute itself inefinetely, or at least until you program it to stop. A break test is another helpful tool within Python programming. If you insert a break test within a 'while' loop, the expression will keep executing the while statement until the break test is 'True'. But as long as the break test is false, the while expression will continue looping.
			</p>
		<h2 class="title"> Stage 2: Lesson 4 <h2>
			<h4>Structured Data: Lists and For Loops</h4>
			<p>
				Similar to a string, which is a sequence of charactrers, a list is also a sequence of characters, but it can contain anything! Unlike a string, a list can contain strings, numbers, and even other lists within itself.
			</p>
			<h4>Mutation</h4>
			<p>
				Mutation is when elements within a list are changed by indexing (similar to indexing in strings). An example would be: x = ['R','i','c','k']. If we index the string in the '0' spot, and change it to 'S', x[0] = 'S', then x = ['S','i','c','k'].
			</p>
			<p>
				Mutation also allows for more than one variable to refer to the same number or string. In this example, both 'n' and 'a' refer to 3 (until, of course, 1 is added to n). 
				<p>
					<br>
					def inc(n):
					<br>
    					n = n+1
    				<br>                         
						a = 3  
					<br>                                 
					return inc(a)
				</p> 
			</p>
			<h4>List Operations</h4>
			<p>
				Lists have a few helpful operations that allow for more flexibility within their programming. Two of the operations are very similar, .append and concatenations. The difference exists in what they produce as an outcome. Where .append adds an element to an already existing list (it mutates the <em>old</em> list), concatenating puts two lists together into a <em>new</em> list.
			</p>
			<h4>More List Operations</h4>
			<p>
				Another list operation is the 'for loop'. This operation acts like a 'while loop', but is more specific. If there were two different lists within a definition, you can specify an element within the first or second list. If your defined function looked like this:
			</p>
			<p>
				def two_functions(a, b)
			</p>
				<br>and your input consisted of two lists like these:
			<p>
				print two_functions([1,2], [3, 4])
			</p>
				<br>a user can use the for loop to specify either list 'a' or 'b' and which number within it.
			<p>
				A tool similar to what we previously learned is '.index'. Just like the '.find' tool, '.index' allows the user to have the computer search within given input, and return the position where the indexed input was first found. The difference is that with '.find', you are searching within a string. With '.index', you are searching within a list.
